# AI-Based-Online-Exam-Monitoring-System

The AI Online Proctoring System is a web-based platform that ensures fair online examinations using Artificial Intelligence. It detects and records suspicious activities such as:

👀 Gaze detection (looking away from screen)

🚶 Unauthorized movement/violence detection

❌ Multiple face detection / impersonation

📷 Recording violations with evidence

This system uses YOLOv5/YOLOv8 models for detection and integrates with a web-based exam platform.

⚡ Features

Secure student login & authentication

Real-time monitoring with webcam feed

AI-powered detection of violations

Automatic alerts for suspicious behavior

Teacher dashboard to review violations

Exam creation & management
